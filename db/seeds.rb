Bring awareness to the underlying emotional volition that is gaining momentum. Deepen your sensitivity to the emotional
filter through which you are experiencing your world.

To assist with this, as you go about your day, Ask yourself the questions:

Where am I?
How do I feel?

Use the questions as an opportunity to become alive to your body and to what is going on for you. These questions
can bring you into the present moment. First connect with the physical space that you are in and ground yourself
into your physical body. feel it in awareness. Then tune into what's going on inside you. Be on the look out for 
negative emotions that are building up and priming you for an unskilful action. A bubble of negativity waiting to pop.

When we are in an irritable mood, we misperceive our world so as to promote anger. We look for reasons to be angry.

with fear more than anything else, often misperceiving the world. Irritability is an excellent example of a mood 
where you are slightly annoyed all the time. When you are irritable, you are always prone to anger.
You are predisposed to anger when you are irritable. Neutral situations are interpreted as negative when you are in 
an irritable mood. When you are irritated, negative situations are viewed as having more negative weight
than they may actually have. If you are in a contemptuous mood you are quicker to

Take a deep breath before meeting them

When with someone can you be completely with them but also hold back some attention for yourself. Keep some awareness back
for your bodily sensations and breathing.
 
Be sensitive to how other people are reacting to you. Heighten your awareness to the other persons emotional reaction. 
You can learn if you are becoming emotional if you are sensitive to how someone is reacting to you. Without saying
anything, the other person becomes a source of awakening your awareness of how you are behaving. And just like straws
blowing in the wind can hint at something coming down the road, you can get early hints of negative emotions (such as anger)
rising up within yourself. You will need to hold back a degree of your attention for yourself. Don't lose awareness of
your own presence. It's easy to be drawn out of your centre in the company of others.

When finishing a conversation or any type of involvement with another person, give attention to how it is that you part company
with them. Are you already half way out the door and still talking with the other person? Notice if you have already disconnected 
from the person mentally, before you physically part company. With some people are you even already exiting the encounter from the
moment you meet them. ",

Take time in your surroundings, perceiving it as though 
you had no words or labels to describe what you see. No names for objects, no names for people. As much as you can
for these few minutes, let go of seeing your world through preconceived labels. 

Add nothing to this experience. Do not add any thought or conditioned response, not even interpretation; just let each
experience be exactly as it is. Relax with each presentation and feel the space that holds the senses and allow presence to arise. - Rodney Smith

Sit comfortably and relaxed, yet also in such a way as to be supportive of being alert. Consciously orient yourself toward
being relaxed and having the next six minutes free to completely let all of your preoccupations go and simply
be with each moment. When you feel restlessness ris up, an urge to do something, or think something over etc. simply
remind yourself that these six minutes are not for that. You can say to youself, 'Not now, later'. When these six minutes
are over, there is the rest of Life to think and to do. Feel the urge to do something, don't repress it, but don't
blindly go along with it either. Give yourself the gift of these few minutes to step back from your world and it's

much for granted. Try to see things just as they are, without any wish to name them. All names fall short of the true

"The Eastern words most often translated as mindfulness are sat and smrti and as B. Alan Wallace a former Buddhist monk
and now researcher points out, the root meaning of these words is remembering or recollecting.  Sati and Smrti imply something more
comprehensive than just the giving of bare attention. Something more than just noticing what is happening as it happens without layering
on anything additional. It is bare attention and also memory.

When practicing a mindfulness technique like observing the breath, as much 
as we are training ourselves to place our attention in an open and non-judging way, we are also strengthening the quality of recollection,
of remembering, of being present. 

When practicing mindfulness of breathing, each time you wake up to having lost awareness of the breath after
your mind has drifted into thoughts, you are also deepening your connection with awareness. You were lost into thoughts and then somehow,
out of nowhere, awareness returns and you notice, Wow, where have I been? This remembering of the breath after the mind leaves it is an act 
of mindfulness. There is a recollection or a remembering of your own presence in the moment and what it is you had been doing. Knowing what is 
happening, and not forgetting it are the two qualities of sati and mindfulness. It is not simply attention. 

Once again this is holding in awareness of what we are doing or intending, requires us to be alive, alert and present. If you
find yourself easily distracted, rushing about, always late. Learning to stay mindful of what you have planned helps to counter this.",

We want to be interesting people. We cover over uncomfortable feelings with unhelpful habits.

If we keep reacting fearfully to feelings such as boredom and loneliness, or need constant entertaining, practice will always
stop whenever these states arise. 

By simply allowing these states to rise up but not indulging in them, they pass through our awareness and can lose their menace.
By allowing them to be but not going along with them, there is the possibility of change. Destructive habits that are used to
