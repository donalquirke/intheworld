          Dear #{@user.first_name},

        %td 
          You asked to receive daily practice intentions, but you haven't told us which ones (sigh).
          %br

          -#=raw "(#{link_to "Select Intentions", intention_url(@intention, :host => "localhost:3000")})"
      %tr
        %td  
          If you would like to practice being more conscious today, then try this intention
          which we randomly picked:
          %br
          %br
      %tr
        %td{:style => "color: #1c70db;"} 
          #{@intention.header}
          -#=raw "(#{link_to "more details »", intention_url(@intention, :host => "localhost:3000")})"
          =raw "(#{link_to "more details »", intention_url(@intention)})"
          %br
          %br
      %tr
        %td
          Take a moment to think about it.
          %br
          %br
      %tr
        %td
          Grasshopper, now is a good time to choose when you can do the practice. Picture yourself doing it. Go on. 
      %tr
        %td
          %br
          To tell us which intentions you want to practice, view all available intentions and choose some.  
          -#=raw "(#{link_to "Select intentions", intentions_url(:host => "localhost:3000")})"
          =raw "(#{link_to "Select intentions", intentions_url})"

          Thanks for your help amigos and amigas.
