Great. You are now registered at MoreMindfully.com 

We're here to help you practice mindfulness. 
  
"But mindfulness is simple" you say.
"True, true". "But that doesn't make it easy to do".
  
People find it difficult to interrupt their busy schedule and practice. 
If they do stop and ´sit´ they can find it difficult to be with a 
thinking-mind that is overly busy. And as for being more mindful in everyday life,
well, that's more difficult still to 'pull off'. Maybe you've already found this out
for yourself?
 
Yup, we know mindfulness is not marketed this way. But then we're meditators,
not marketeers.
  
Mindfulness is a great thing to do. All that scientific research means something. 
Be willing to approach the pracice as if learning a musical instrument. It will take 
time, patience and initially you may well think you can't do it. (That's normal)
  
Peace, stillness, spaciousness and clarity are natually within you.
All you have to do is create the conditions for them to 'stand out' more in
your experience.  

Right now we are in closed beta testing. So we will contact you again once we are
able to take on more people. 

Thank you for your interest.
 
Yours sincerely,
The MoreMindfully team.
