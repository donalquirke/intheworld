Mindful Intentions

Am using mailcatcher for testing emails locally.
https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher

From the respistory
"To set up your rails app, I recommend adding this to your environment/development.rb:
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => "localhost", :port => 1025 }"

NOTE I did an unistall of mailcatcher... so it isn't actually being used right now.
